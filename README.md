# **Comprehensive Machine Learning Prediction Web Application** üìä

This project is a versatile **Streamlit-based web application** that offers four distinct types of predictions:
1. **Drug Recommendation Prediction** üíä
2. **Spam Email Detection** ‚úâÔ∏è
3. **Stock Price Prediction** üìà
4. **Health Disease Prediction** (Cancer, CHD Heart Disease, Diabetes, Stroke) üè•

The app leverages various **machine learning algorithms** for each task, allowing users to train models, visualize performance metrics, and make real-time predictions.

  - Displays classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy for each model.
  - Allows users to compare models with different accuracy scores.

### **2. Spam Email Detection** ‚úâÔ∏è
- **Goal**: Detect whether an email is spam or not based on its content.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **MultinomialNB**
  - **GaussianNB**
  - **BernoulliNB**
  - **ComplementNB**
- **Key Features**:
  - Input custom email content to check if it's classified as spam or ham.
  - Visualization of word clouds for spam and non-spam emails.
  - Displays the classification report, confusion matrix, and prediction accuracy.
  - Model saving functionality for future use.

### **3. Stock Price Prediction** üìà
- **Goal**: Predict the future stock prices of companies based on their historical data.
- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - **Linear Regression**
- **Key Features**:
  - Select from popular stocks (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN) or enter a custom stock ticker.
  - Fetches historical stock price data from **Yahoo Finance**.
  - Predicts future stock prices based on the last 10 years of data using linear regression.
  - Displays stock summary, stock price charts, model metrics (R¬≤, MAE, MSE), and prediction charts.
  - Users can input future days to predict stock prices.

### **4. Health Disease Prediction** üè•
- **Goal**: Predict the risk of diseases like Cancer, CHD Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Stroke.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Naive Bayes** (GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB, ComplementNB)
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Logistic Regression**
- **Key Features**:
  - Input custom health data to predict disease risk.
  - Handles categorical data encoding and missing value imputation.
  - Applies **SMOTE** for imbalanced datasets to improve predictions.
  - Displays classification report, confusion matrix, accuracy, and correlation matrix for feature relationships.
  - Users can test models with their own feature values for real-time disease prediction.
